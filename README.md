# MATLAB Rocket Simulation

This project simulates a 2-stage rocket launch with realistic physics including mass depletion, stage separation, thrust, gravity, and drag.

## How to Run

1. Make sure the following files are in the same folder:
   - `simulateRocket.m`
   - `rocket.m`
   - `stage.m`
2. Open MATLAB and run `simulateRocket.m`.

## What It Tracks

- Altitude  
- Velocity  
- Net force  
- Mass of each stage over time  
- Total rocket mass  
- Stage separation points  
- Apoapsis (peak altitude)
